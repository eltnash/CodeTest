You're on the right track with that distinction! Think of **statements** as complete thoughts, like a full sentence in human language. They are capable of standing on their own, conveying a complete idea, intention, or command.

For example, in JavaScript, something like:

```javascript
let x = 10;
```

is a **statement** because it's a complete instruction: "Assign the value 10 to the variable `x`."

An **expression**, on the other hand, is more like a piece of that thought—a fragment that doesn't communicate a full idea on its own but contributes to something bigger. For instance:

```javascript
x + 5
```

This is an **expression**. It's part of a statement, but it doesn’t tell us what to *do* with the result—it just evaluates to a value (`15` if `x` is `10`).

In a nutshell:

- **Statements**: Complete commands or instructions that accomplish something.
- **Expressions**: Building blocks that result in a value but often need to be part of a statement to be useful.

This is like making a sandwich: the **statement** is the completed sandwich (ready to eat!), while an **expression** is just one ingredient (like the cheese), essential but incomplete on its own.


### EXAMPLE


1. console.log(Math.max(2,4))  // -> 4  statement
            //expression

2. console.log(Math.min(2,4)+100); // -> 102 statement
              //expression


3. let items = [ {price: 30}, {price: 20}, {price: 50} ]; // Statement
                //Expressions

    let discount = function(price) {
        return price * 0.8;  // Expression
    };  // Statement


    let total = discount(items[0].price) + discount(items[1].price) + discount(items[2].price); //Statement
                //Expression

    console.log(total); //Statement
