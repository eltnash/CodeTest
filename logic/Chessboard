Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.


breakdown

we want a program that takes an input value and that input value will output a pattern of hash tag symbols forming a grid which is  has dimensions equal in both width (inputvalue) * height (inputvalue).


the program creates a string of concatenated characters representing and 8x8 grid

on each line we need repetitively to generate the hashtag symobl and and empty space in succession until equals the value inputted, the total of lines generated should equal the value inputted

how do i continus


how do we create an 8x8 grid of a series of white spaces and "#" horizontally and vertically ?

print horizontally 8 times using newline characters to separate lines

how do we first  print a white space followed by a "#" symbol ?
